    ## #   aisle_id <int>, department_id <int>, aisle <chr>, department <chr>

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

The dataset is extensive, providing details on the online grocery
service. Observations are the level of items in an order by user. There
are user / order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, order hour,
and reordered. There are also item variables – name, aisle, department,
and some numeric codes. Structurally, we can see that products are in
aisles, aisles are in departments, and the tracker supplies information
about each user, the products they buy, and where those products are
found around local stores. Users are also tracked for how often they
make orders, what they order and reorder, the order in which they shop,
and when they shop. In this dataset, we are given the information for
over 3 million orders from over 200k users.

#### A little more context…

**How many aisles are there, and which are most items from?**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles and most items are from the fresh vegetables aisle.

**Plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle…**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_kpr2118_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

From this plot we can see how many items were ordered in each aisle…
arranged by aisle with the least to the most items ordered. We can tell
things such as, butter is ordered the least and fresh vegetables and
fruits are ordered significantly more than other items.

**Table showing three most popular items in specified aisles… and how
many times they have been ordered…**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(
    rank = min_rank(desc(n))
  ) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

From this table, we can see the 3 most popular items ordered from the
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care” and “packaged vegetables fruits”
aisles - including how many times they have been ordered. The top
ranking items in each aisle are LIght Brown Sugar, Snack Sticks Chicken
and Rice Recipe Dog Treats, and Organic Baby Spinach, respectively.

**Table showing the mean hour of the day at which specified items are
ordered on each day of the week…**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

| product\_name    |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |
| :--------------- | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: |
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 | 15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 | 14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |

In this table, we see the mean hour of the day, per day of the week,
that Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered. Coffee Ice Cream
is mainly ordered between hour 12 and 16. Pink Lady Apples are ordered
around hours 11 and 15.

## Problem 2

Load and tidy the data…

``` r
accel_df = read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
accel_df
```
